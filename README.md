# pkg-lint

Lint your project.janet to see if it's compliant for inclusion in the pkgs list.

## Status

This is a draft program, as yet woefully incomplete.

## Usage

After building and moving the `pkg-lint` executable to your path, you can call `pkg-link <filename>` to check the project.janet file for a valid project name.
